Added a new class MyTemplatedClass2 and the corresponding test program which shows how to define a templated class
member function definition in separate file.

Here we have one templated class declared in TemplatedClass2.h file
and the definition of Constructor and other funcions of class is given in TemplatedClass2.cpp

A Test program main2.cpp also added to show the demo.
